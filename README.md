# KRY code assignment

*Qingshan's progress*

- Stored added services into the database with columns:
   - url: url
   - name: hostName
   - user: cookie value of the add request
- Added delete for individual service
- Send get request to each service for health check, and timeout for slow service
- Refresh the page at a fixed intervals to update the services status
- Validate service input and return 400 for invalid url
- Store and show added service for each user identified by cookie 

*TODOs*
- Add update on both frontend and backend
- Error response code handling on frontend, show alert message for 400 response caused by invalid url input.
- Add lock to avoid race condition
- Polish UI

*Unknown Issue*
- For unknown reason, the gradle doesn't pick up the changes under static/code.js. Disabling the file cache on the handler doesn't seem to solve the problem so I moved all the js code under the html.

One of our developers built a simple service poller.
The service consists of a backend service written in Vert.x (https://vertx.io/) that keeps a list of services (defined by a URL), and periodically does a HTTP GET to each and saves the response ("OK" or "FAIL").

Unfortunately, the original developer din't finish the job, and it's now up to you to complete the thing.
Some of the issues are critical, and absolutely need to be fixed for this assignment to be considered complete.
There is also a wishlist of features in two separate tracks - if you have time left, please choose *one* of the tracks and complete as many of those issues as you can.

Critical issues (required to complete the assignment):

- Whenever the server is restarted, any added services disappear
- There's no way to delete individual services
- We want to be able to name services and remember when they were added
- The HTTP poller is not implemented

Frontend/Web track:
- We want full create/update/delete functionality for services
- The results from the poller are not automatically shown to the user (you have to reload the page to see results)
- We want to have informative and nice looking animations on add/remove services

Backend track
- Simultaneous writes sometimes causes strange behavior
- Protect the poller from misbehaving services (for example answering really slowly)
- Service URL's are not validated in any way ("sdgf" is probably not a valid service)
- A user (with a different cookie/local storage) should not see the services added by another user

Spend maximum four hours working on this assignment - make sure to finish the issues you start.

Put the code in a git repo on GitHub and send us the link (niklas.holmqvist@kry.se) when you are done.

Good luck!

# Building
We recommend using IntelliJ as it's what we use day to day at the KRY office.
In intelliJ, choose
```
New -> New from existing sources -> Import project from external model -> Gradle -> select "use gradle wrapper configuration"
```

You can also run gradle directly from the command line:
```
./gradlew clean run
```
